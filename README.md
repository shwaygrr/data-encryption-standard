## Chwoeger Charleston - Crytopgraphy

## Overview
This project implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm in C++. DES is a widely used symmetric-key algorithm for data encryption and decryption. DES operates on 64-bit blocks of plaintext using a 56-bit key, applying various permutations and substitutions to achieve encryption and decryption.

## Implementation Details
- Language: C++
- Mode of Operation: Electronic Code Block (ECB) -- Was not able to implement in time but DES still works for 64-bit
- Key Length: 64 bits
- Block Size: 64 bits



## Files Included
- `des.cpp`: The main source code file containing the implementation of the DES algorithm.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.
