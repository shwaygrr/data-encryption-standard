# Data Encryption Standard (DES) Implementation

## Overview
This project implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, a widely used symmetric-key algorithm for data encryption and decryption. DES operates on 64-bit blocks of plaintext using a 56-bit key, applying various permutations and substitutions to achieve encryption and decryption.

## Assignment Description
For this assignment, the task is to implement the DES algorithm using any programming language of your choice. The recommended languages are C/C++ or Java. You can work individually or in a team of two students.

### Requirements:
- Implement DES algorithm to perform encryption and decryption.
- Accept plaintext and a secret key from the user.
- Select a mode of operation for encryption (e.g., ECB, CBC, etc.).
- Avoid copying code directly from the Internet; the goal is to understand the algorithm deeply.

## Implementation Details
- Language: C++
- Mode of Operation: TBD
- Key Length: 56 bits
- Block Size: 64 bits

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Execute the compiled binary.
5. Follow the prompts to input plaintext and secret key.
6. View the generated ciphertext and decrypted plaintext.

## Files Included
- `des.cpp`: The main source code file containing the implementation of the DES algorithm.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.
- `LICENSE`: The license file specifying the terms of use for the project.

## Grade Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Compliance with assignment requirements.
- Demonstration of understanding of the DES algorithm.
- Code quality and documentation.
- Avoidance of direct code copying from the Internet.
